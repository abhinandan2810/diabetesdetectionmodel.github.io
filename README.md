Diabetes Prediction Model

Together, Abhinandan (MCA 590013661) and Siddhant Choudhary (MCA 590014502) has created this project to analyze and predict the likelihood of diabetes.

In this project, we will be using 4 classification models—Logistic Regression,Random Forests to predict diabetes and Tkinter for making GUI. Each of these models will help us understand the data better and make accurate predictions.

Definitions
Logistic Regression: A statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the target variable is categorical and usually binary (e.g., "Diabetes" or "No Diabetes"). Logistic regression calculates the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric, supervised learning algorithm often applied to classification and regression tasks. It works on the idea that similar data points exist close to each other in the feature space, making it ideal for predicting outcomes based on proximity.

Random Forests: An ensemble learning method used mainly for classification and regression. This model builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of their predictions (for classification) or the average (for regression).
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A supervised learning model used primarily for classification tasks. SVMs find the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes in high-dimensional space.

Diabetes Overview
Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. It is primarily characterized by high blood sugar levels, either due to the body’s inability to produce enough insulin (Type 1 Diabetes) or ineffective use of insulin (Type 2 Diabetes).

When left untreated, high blood sugar can cause serious health problems, including heart disease, nerve damage, kidney failure, and vision loss. Predicting the likelihood of diabetes at an early stage helps in taking preventive measures to avoid complications.

Project Aim
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model for diabetes detection using a variety of machine learning algorithms, gain in-depth insights from the data, and visualize key factors that contribute to diabetes risk. By training the model on a well-established dataset and using effective features, we strive to create an accurate and user-friendly system for diabetes prediction.

This analysis will help in understanding the importance of various health parameters, such as Glucose Levels, Blood Pressure, BMI, and other factors, in determining the risk of diabetes.

Dataset Used
The dataset used for this project is based on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which is widely recognized for research on predicting diabetes. The dataset includes medical records with multiple health indicators like Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age.

Key Objectives
To explore and clean the dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
To train multiple machine learning models and evaluate their effectiveness.
To visualize and interpret the results, providing insights into factors influencing diabetes.
To create an interactive prediction system using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with tkinter for user-friendly diabetes prediction.
The project showcases a blend of machine learning techniques, data analysis, and practical application, making it a valuable tool for educational and clinical purposes.

The GUI shows the result based on the given input if the patient is Diabetic or Not Diabetic.
